<p class="para">
  When determing the sentencing for a crime, a person's likelihood to commit
  another crime is assesed. I believe that while it makes mistakes sometimes and does not always give accurte readings,
  it is a valuable resource when determing a persons punishment for a crime.

<p class="para2">
  However, since it is still an algorithim and through a computer, I do not believe it should
  be as heavily considered as the case itself. Computers make mistakes and can't be universally effective.
  Every case is different.
